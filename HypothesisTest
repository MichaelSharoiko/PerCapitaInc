-Testing if the model shows convergence at the 1% level of significance-

the null and alternative hypothesis:

H0: B2>0
H1: B2<0

The convergence hypothesis specifies a specific sign of the slope.
if B2 is negative, then the lower the income is per capita in 1929,
the faster is growth from 1929 to 2018. This signifies an inverse
relationship so we will use a one-tailed test.

t=(-.00121)/.00010=-12.1

the one-tailed, 1% critical value for the T-distribution with 46 degrees of freedom is:
> qt(.01,47)
[1] -2.408345

Since the t statistic is beyond the critical statistic of 2.041, 
we can reject the null that the slope is equal or greater than zero. 
We accept the alternative hypothesis which is that there is convergence in the data.
This makes sense that it is convergence because there is a negative 
relationship between per cap income and the growth rate.
